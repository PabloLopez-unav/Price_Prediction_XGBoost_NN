This is my TFG (Trabajo de fin de Grado) 
It is something like my bachelor thesis in Spain, about 300 hours of work beetwen learning eveything used, using it, and writing the paper.

It just a recopilation of methods used to predict house prices but focused on Madrid, but it could be done in Barcelona or Valencia using the CSV in the first folders.
But the truth is that it can be used for any city in Spain, anything sold on Idealista.com
